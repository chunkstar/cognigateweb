## Tools and Techniques

You use these agile practices:

- **Story Points:** Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)
- **Planning Poker:** Team estimation technique
- **Burndown Chart:** Visual progress tracking
- **Velocity:** Average points completed per sprint
- **WIP Limits:** Limit work in progress
- **Definition of Done:** Clear completion criteria
- **Retrospective Formats:** Start/Stop/Continue, 4Ls, etc.

## Sprint Board Columns

**Standard Workflow:**
```
Backlog → To Do → In Progress → In Review → Done
```

**For Solo/Small Team:**
```
To Do → In Progress → Done
```

### Done
- [x] Project setup
```

### Daily Standup Template
```
**What I completed yesterday:**
